# Challenge, week 3: Password Generator

## In this project I was tasked to apply Java Script to starter code consisting of HTML and CSS for a password generator application. 

### In order to adhere to the acceptance criteria for the assignment the password generator starts with clicking on the "Generate Password" button. Therefore, this click event function needed to initiate the series of all the other functions required for the password generator. In other words, all the other functions are nested in the function triggered by the button click.

### Structuring this nested series of functions required me to come to a much better understanding than I previously had of the scope of variable, when and where variables can/should be declared, and the relationship of parameters and arguments in functions. Also, building the possible characters series from which the password is generated required me to learn about building strings using a loop and using false/true values to make variables usable in the function. Boy howdy! It was a challenging assignment. Tears were shed. But, in the end I do feel I have a better (maybe not perfect or even fantastic, but better) understanding of all those topics. 

### My Password Generator page was built using [Git Hub Pages](https://mcamy2001.github.io/password-generator/).

#### Citation: I looked up the formula for generating a random string here: progrmiz.com

#### Collaborator: I received much explanation and instruction on variable scope, parameters/arguments, and string building from Phil Callister (my husband, who also let me cry on his shoulder when frustration bubbled over).
